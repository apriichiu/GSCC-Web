    # == Attributes after created
    #
    # Only attributes you specified are saved in the created album object.
    # If you want to access any other attributes, you need to fetch the album info via Graph API.
    #
    #   me = FbGraph::User.me(ACCESS_TOKEN)
    #   album = me.album!(
    #     :name => 'FbGraph test',

    #   album.created_time # => nil
    #   album.fetch
    #   album.from # => me
    #   album.created_time # => Sun Sep 12 01:18:36 +0900 2010
    #
    # == Bug of Graph API
    #
    # According facebook's document, the key for +description+ should be +description+ both when fetching and creating,
    # but actually you need to use +message+ instead of +description+ only when creating.
    # It probably facebook's bug, and it might be fixed suddenly.
    # I highly recommend to send same value both as +description+ and +message+ when creating,
    # then your code will work without any code change.
