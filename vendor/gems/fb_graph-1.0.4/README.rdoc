Almost all connectionsã€€for each object are also supported. (Private message connections are not supported yet)

Plus, you can play an Rails sample app here. http://fbgraphsample.heroku.com/

=== GET

==== Basic Objects

  user = FbGraph::User.me(ACCESS_TOKEN)

  user = FbGraph::User.fetch('matake')
  user.name    # => 'Nov Matake'
  user.picture # => 'https://graph.facebook.com/matake/picture'

  # fb_graph doesn't access to Graph API until you call "fetch"
  user = FbGraph::User.new('matake', :access_token => YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN)
  user.identifier # => "matake"
  user.name # => nil
  user.link # => nil
  user.fetch
  user.name # => "Nov Matake"
  user.description # => "http://www.facebook.com/matake"

  page = FbGraph::Page.fetch('smartfmteam')
  page.name     # => 'smart.fm'
  page.picture  # => 'https://graph.facebook.com/smart.fm/picture'

  :

==== Connections

  # Public connections
  user = FbGraph::User.fetch('matake')
  user.feed
  user.posts
  user.friends
  user.tagged
  :
  
  # Private connections requires "access_token"
  FbGraph::User.new('matake').friends # => raise FbGraph::Unauthorized
  user = FbGraph::User.fetch('matake', :access_token => ACCESS_TOKEN)
  user.albums
  user.events

  likes = user.likes # => Array of FbGraph::Like
  likes.next         # => Array of FbGraph::Like (next page)
  likes.previous     # => Array of FbGraph::Like (previous page)
  likes.collection.next     # => Hash for pagination options (ex. {"limit"=>"25", "until"=>"2010-08-08T03:17:21+0000"})
  likes.collection.previous # => Hash for pagination options (ex. {"limit"=>"25", "since"=>"2010-08-08T06:28:20+0000"})

=== Authentication

Both Facebook JavaScript SDK and normal OAuth2 flow is supported.
Below I show simple sample code.
You can also see http://github.com/nov/fb_graph_sample for more details Rails3 sample application.

==== JavaScript SDK

  fb_auth = FbGraph::Auth.new(YOUR_APP_ID, YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET)
  fb_auth.client # => OAuth2::Client

  # get Facebook's auth cookie in advance using their JS SDK
  fb_auth.from_cookie(cookies)
  fb_auth.access_token # => OAuth2::AccessToken
  fb_auth.user         # => FbGraph::User (only basic attributes)
  fb_auth.user.fetch   # => fetch more details

==== Normal OAuth2 Flow

  # redirect user to facebook
  redirect_to fb_auth.client.web_server.authorize_url(
    :redirect_uri => "http://your.client.com/facebook/callback",
    :scope => "email,read_stream,offline_access"
  )

  # in callback
  fb_auth.client.web_server.get_access_token(
    params[:code],
    :redirect_uri => callback_facebook_url
  ) # => OAuth2::AccessToken
  FbGraph::User.me(access_token).fetch # => fetch user

=== Analytics

  app = FbGraph::Application.new(YOUR_APP_ID, :secret => YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET)
  app.insights # => Array of FbGraph::Insight

== Documents

Currently fb_graph isn't so well documented.

I'm continuously updating RDoc now, but writing all documents <b>in English</b> is heavy task for me.

Please see RDoc.info (http://rdoc.info/github/nov/fb_graph), and if the document is missing or hard to understand, please contact me on github.

I'll add more documents or sample code.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
