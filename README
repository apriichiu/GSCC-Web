This repository contains the source code for the GSCC website.

Files are laid out in the typical rails application fashion. 

Interesting 'features' of the codebase include haml/sass instead of
erb, and openid everywhere instead of our own authentication. An event
system and a resource management system. We call the facebook GraphAPI
via the "fb_graph" gem written by Nov Matake
(http://github.com/nov/fb_graph/tree/master/lib/fb_graph/). You can
see the documentation here: http://rdoc.info/github/nov/fb_graph/master

Please create "config/facebook.yml" and fill in your app_id,
client_secret, client_id, perms, and also page_id (this is the id of
the page which events will be synced from). See the following example:

------------------------
development: &defaults
  app_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  client_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  client_secret: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  perms: offline_access,manage_pages
  page_id: xxxxxxxxxxxx

test:
  <<: *defaults

production:
  <<: *defaults
-------------------------------------------------
