%p
At GSCC one of our values is growing in community: caring for one another and holding one another accountable as we study God's word, share, pray and outreach together.
%p
GSCC has small groups that gather by different ages and life stages, speak different languages, in different cities, and on different days of the week. If you are looking for a community to grow with, we invite you to visit our small groups and find one that is right for you.
